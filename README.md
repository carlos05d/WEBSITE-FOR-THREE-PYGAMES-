# Website for Three Pygames

Welcome to the **Website for Three Pygames**! This is a project where three Pygame-based games are showcased on a website. The games are built with Python and Pygame, providing interactive and fun experiences for users. This website allows players to access and play the games directly from their browser.

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at creating an interactive website that hosts three different games built using **Pygame**, a popular library for making 2D games with Python. The website allows users to easily navigate between the games, play them, and enjoy different gaming experiences.

## Features

- **Three Different Games**: A variety of Pygame-based games that provide different types of gameplay experiences.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, so it works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Game Instructions**: Each game comes with an explanation of how to play, ensuring that users can easily get started.
- **Game Statistics**: Some games may track high scores or other player statistics.

## Games

### Game 1 - **Dama**

**Description**:  
Dama is a traditional strategy board game played on a 10x10 grid, commonly popular in countries like Morocco, Turkey, and other regions. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent’s pieces by jumping over them and to move your pieces across the board in such a way that you can outmaneuver your opponent. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent’s pieces or when no legal moves remain.

**Features**:  
- **2-player gameplay**: Dama is a game for two players, where one player uses light pieces and the other uses dark pieces.
- **Capturing**: Players capture the opponent's pieces by jumping over them horizontally or vertically.
- **Kinging**: When a piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is "kinged" and gains the ability to move diagonally.
- **Simple rules, challenging strategy**: While the rules are simple, the game requires strategic thinking and planning to win.

---

### How to Play the Game:

1. **Setup**:  
   The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Each player starts with 20 pieces placed on the dark squares of the first four rows on their side. The pieces can only move on dark squares.

2. **Movement**:  
   - **Normal Pieces**: Your pieces can move one square forward diagonally. 
   - **Jumping**: If there is an opponent's piece in an adjacent square, and the square directly after it is empty, you can "jump" over the opponent’s piece to capture it. You must remove the captured piece from the board.
   
3. **Kinging**:  
   - If you move a piece to the last row on the opponent's side of the board, it gets "kinged" and can move both forward and backward, as well as diagonally in any direction.
   - A kinged piece can jump over opponent’s pieces both forward and backward.

4. **Winning the Game**:  
   You win the game by either:
   - Capturing all of the opponent’s pieces.
   - Creating a situation where your opponent has no legal moves left.

5. **Rules to Keep in Mind**:
   - A player must make a capture if possible.
   - If a player can capture multiple pieces in one turn, they must do so.
   - The game is over when one player either has no pieces left or cannot make any more legal moves.

This game is fun and offers strategic depth while maintaining simple mechanics. It’s a great game for anyone who enjoys thinking several moves ahead!

### Game 2 - **Snake**

**Description**:  
Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that continuously moves around the screen, eating food items that appear randomly. The snake grows longer each time it eats food, and the objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without crashing into walls or its own tail. It’s a simple but addictive game that tests your reflexes and strategic thinking.

**Features**:  
- **Endless gameplay**: The snake keeps growing as long as it eats food and doesn’t hit anything.
- **Increased difficulty**: The more the snake eats, the longer it becomes, making it harder to avoid collisions.
- **Simple controls**: Control the snake’s direction with arrow keys or swipe gestures.
- **Score tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats more food. The longer the snake grows, the higher the score.

---

### How to Play the Game:

1. **Starting the Game**:  
   - When the game starts, a snake appears at the center of the screen, and food items will start to appear randomly on the screen.
   
2. **Movement**:  
   - You control the snake by pressing the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on the keyboard or by swiping in the corresponding direction on a touchscreen device.
   - The snake continuously moves forward, and you can only control its direction. 

3. **Eating Food**:  
   - Your goal is to make the snake eat the food items that appear on the screen. Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
   
4. **Avoiding Collisions**:  
   - As the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to avoid running into the walls or into its own body.
   - If the snake crashes into a wall or itself, the game ends.

5. **Winning/Scoring**:  
   - The game doesn’t have a "win" condition; the goal is to get the highest possible score.
   - The score is based on how many food items the snake eats. The longer the snake gets, the higher the score.

6. **Game Over**:  
   - The game ends when the snake either collides with a wall or runs into its own tail.
   - After the game is over, your score is displayed, and you can choose to restart and try for a higher score.

**Snake** is a fast-paced, simple, and fun game where you can challenge yourself to keep the snake growing longer while avoiding obstacles. Perfect for quick gaming sessions and improving reflexes!

### Game 3 - **Tetris**

**Description**:  
Tetris is a highly popular and iconic puzzle game where the player must rotate and position falling blocks, known as tetrominoes, to complete horizontal lines. Once a line is filled with blocks, it disappears, and the player earns points. The objective is to prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen, as the game ends if the blocks reach the top. The game features increasing difficulty as the blocks fall faster over time.

**Features**:  
- **Classic puzzle gameplay**: Rotate and move falling tetrominoes to complete lines.
- **Endless challenge**: The speed of falling blocks increases with every level, providing a challenging and fast-paced experience.
- **Score tracking**: Points are awarded for clearing lines, and the player can track their score throughout the game.
- **Simple mechanics**: Easy-to-learn but hard-to-master gameplay that anyone can pick up.

---

### How to Play the Game:

1. **Starting the Game**:  
   - The game begins with an empty grid, and tetrominoes start falling from the top of the screen. You need to move and rotate the blocks to fit them into the grid.

2. **Moving the Blocks**:  
   - Use the arrow keys (or swipe gestures on mobile) to move the falling tetromino left, right, or down.
   - You can rotate the tetrominoes to fit them better into the grid. Typically, this is done by pressing the "up" arrow key or another key (depending on your setup).
   
3. **Clearing Lines**:  
   - The objective is to fill a horizontal line with blocks. Once a line is filled, it disappears, and you earn points.
   - The more lines you clear at once, the more points you earn. Clearing multiple lines at once (like 2 or 4) can give you a combo bonus.

4. **Increasing Speed**:  
   - As you progress through the game, the speed at which the tetrominoes fall will gradually increase, making the game harder. You must adjust your strategy and speed of movement to keep up.

5. **Game Over**:  
   - The game ends if the blocks reach the top of the screen and there is no room to place a new tetromino.
   - At this point, your final score is displayed, and you can start a new game.

6. **Scoring**:  
   - You score points for each line that you clear. Clearing multiple lines at once (known as a "Tetris" when four lines are cleared simultaneously) gives you a higher score.
   - The score increases as you complete levels and clear more lines.

**Tetris** is a timeless puzzle game that requires quick thinking and precise control. It's easy to get into but offers an endless challenge as the game speeds up. Whether you're aiming for a high score or just trying to beat your last record, Tetris is a fun and engaging experience!
